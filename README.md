## üìù Project Description

**Dosadoctor** is your personal dosa inspector. It uses AI to scan your dosa and detect how much of it is burnt‚Äîso you never have to eat charcoal pancakes again. Finally, a tool to help you impress your family.

---

### The Problem 
People all over the world are silently suffering. Not from war or inflation but from dosas that are too burnt, too raw, or both at once. These poor souls need a hero. Or better, an AI.

---

### The Solution
We‚Äôve built an AI-powered dosa diagnostic tool that judges your dosa better than Gordon Ramsay.  
Upload a dosa photo, and **Dosadoctor** will tell you the percentage of burnt area.
